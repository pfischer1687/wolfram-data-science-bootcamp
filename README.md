  Using Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test data to predict percentage growth of Microsoft Corporation stock price through 2023 Q1
</h1>

My submission from the Wolfram Data Science Boot Camp 2020 which resulted in the following certification:
Wolfram Certified Level II in Multiparadigm Data Science.

## Abstract

Every year, the Federal Reserve publishes quarterly predictions for the
following two years of domestic macroeconomic variables in both baseline and
severely adverse conditions. Historical data of these variables (also
published under this act by the Federal Reserve) from 2001 to 2020 is used to
make a linear regression model of Microsoft Corporation stock price
percentage growth (MSFT % growth) during this period. This model is used to
predict the values of MSFT % growth under both baseline and severely adverse
conditions until the end of the first quarter of 2023. The model has an r^2
value of 0.0594964 and the predictions are qualitatively found to make
inaccurate predictions of current MSFT % growth data. I hypothesize that the
inaccuracy of the model is based on the independence of the data from the
macroeconomic variables and the prediction for the first two quarters of 2020
is inaccurate because the global pandemic accelerated at an unprecedented
pace global dependence on Microsoft Corporation technology.
